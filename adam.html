            </div>
            <p>51% of students in further education didn't seek help when they needed it. This statistic displays a problem for universities personal help programmes, how can you help someone if you don't know they need help? We wanted to know how we can help these individuals in need.</p>
            <p>This project was part of a programme called 3DS, which is designed to help aspiring entrepreneurs create a product. We competed against six other product teams to develop a comprehensive product plan in just two days.</p>
            <p>ADAM is a safe, first response for students who need support but aren't ready to seek it. ADAM provides informative articles about personal issues that are designed to help answer common problems and relieve anxiety. It also includes chat interfaces for 24/hr support all while staying anonymous when needed.</p>

            <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the student community, we conducted some guerrilla interviews on campus in London. Combined with a survey, with results from other student communities, we came to the following conclusions:</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>As the sole designer of the group, I led an ideation session that included brainstorming exercises and rapid prototyping tasks. The efforts of our collaboration resulted in a paper prototype that supported our findings.</p>
            <p>I then took our paper sketches and created some detailed screen designs and a simple prototype using inVision. Our ability to create a complete product design in short time gave us an advantage over the other teams who only just specified the concepts and financial details of the product. Unfortunately due to the short period and business focus of the project no user testing took place with these prototypes</p>

            <h3>Financial Model Development</h3>
            <p>To identify how best to market and promote such a product comes down to who uses it and how we fund it, we knew who the user was but how would the product make money? The nature of the product reflected heavily on the funding approach. The supportive quality of the product also deterred us from introducing a cost for the student, help and support should always be free to those who need it.
            </p>
            <p>Choosing a non-profit better aligned with the companies culture. It also has a significant impact on how potential investors (universities, government funding, and local corporations) viewed the product. These sources were thought to be the primary source of financing, using investors like this ensures that ADAM is accessible with no cost to those who need it.</p>

            <h3>Pitching &amp; Awards</h3>
            <p>The final product pitch was the most unfamiliar aspect of this project. Presenting ideas, designs and financial details was a new kind of skill that I had never tested before. However, preparation and practising our pitch allowed us to revisit features of the product and refine them. The pitch was 3 minutes and 2 minutes of Q&A, this was to a panel of 5 different businesses.</p>
            <p>In reflection, the pitch was well prepared and presented. This reflected on our team and the work that had been done. As a result, we won 2 awards "Best Pitch" and "Overall Winner". This meant that we would now present our work to a board of potential investors with the chance of receiving investment.</p>

            <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
            <p>The responsibility of designing a product and thinking about how it makes money produced new challenges allowing me to reflect on the real product design process and how it might be affected by financing. 
            <br><br>
            Understanding every aspect of how the company works (or will work) and fusing this with human-centred design can provide a realistic and purposeful product.</p>
