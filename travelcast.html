            <p>Holiday Destination Weather Forecaster</p>
            <p>Weather apps are an oversaturated market, so many solutions and variation of tools. When asked as part of my studies to make one
                    I thought that rather than improving an existing use case discover a user with distinct needs and create a custom app that fits their need
                    specifically.
                    <br><br>
                    Travelcast does precisely that, travellers all around the world are always making weather-based decisions, but current solutions lead to a
                    very complicated process using more than one service at any one time. Travelcast puts all of these required features under one app
                    and streamlines the users' flow.</p>

            <p>Brainstorming which types of people use weather apps for specific reasons informed our decisions on whom to interview. 
                    As we were a large group, we were able to talk to 7 travellers and observe a few of them performing tasks. Some interesting results

            <p>Using React introduced a learning curve as no one in the team was familiar with it, however, with the time we had (2 weeks) we were
                    pleased with the result. We were disappointed that the final product did not match the design as we'd expected but is something that
                    would have been accomplished with a few more days.</p>

            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>Once the projects design was complete we conducted a heuristic evaluation which led to the bellow proposed improvements. We ran
                this alongside the development, this allowed minute changes to be made during the build. An empricle evualtion method is prefered 
                over team heurisitics. However, with little resources and time a heuristic evaluation was sufficent enough. Empericle evaluations
                were also outside the scope of the project brief.

            <p>As with many of my academic projects, Developing the product is a critical part. I pride myself on my ability to balance both ensuring
                    the product is valuable and feasible to implement with my skill set. Iâ€™m also starting to see which research methods produce the most
                    exciting results. This reflection helps other projects going forward.</p>
