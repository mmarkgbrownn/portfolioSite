            <p>Holiday Destination Weather Forecaster</p>
            <p>Weather apps are an oversaturated market, so many solutions and variation of tools. When asked as part of my studies to make one I thought that rather than improving an existing use case discover a user with distinct needs and create a custom app that fits their need specifically. 
            <br><br>
            Travelcast does precisely that, travellers all around the world are always making weather-based decisions, but current solutions lead to a very complicated process using more than one service at any one time. Travelcast puts all of these required features under one app and streamlines the users' flow.</p>

            <p>Brainstorming which types of people use weather apps for specific reasons informed our decisions on whom to interview. As we were a large group, we were able to talk to 7 travellers and observe a few of them performing tasks. Some interesting results were:</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Using React introduced a learning curve as no one in the team was familiar with it, however, with the time we had (2 weeks) we were pleased with the result. We were disappointed that the final product did not match the design as we'd expected but is something that would have been accomplished with a few more days. Unfortunately, due to the deployment platforms pricing constraints, the finished live app is no longer available.</p>

        <section id="evaluation">
            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>Once the design of the project was complete, we conducted a heuristic evaluation which led to the bellow proposed improvements. We ran this alongside the development, this allowed minute changes to be made during the build. An empirical evaluation method is preferred over team heuristics. However, with little resources and time, a heuristic evaluation was sufficient enough. Empirical evaluations were also outside the scope of the project brief.</p>

        <section id="takeaway">
            <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
            <p>As with many of my academic projects, Developing the product is a critical part. I pride myself on my ability to balance both ensuring the product is valuable and feasible to implement with my skill set. Iâ€™m also starting to understand that no single design process works for every project, a better approach requires thinking about what data and research the product requires and choosing design research methods as necessary. This reflection helps other projects going forward.
