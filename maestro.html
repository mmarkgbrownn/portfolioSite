            <p>Musical Education Web App for Children</p>
            <p>People who use the internet as a learning resource claim that their learning experience is poor, resources are also inconsistent or poorly written.<br><br>Maestro is a musical teaching environment primarily designed for younger children (5-11 years). Maestro aims to help young people learn music theory, rhythm, and trivia. Each of these interactive components explores different areas to give the user a holistic musical knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Survey &amp; Interview</h2>
            <p>We distributed a survey to see what kinds of solutions people are currently using, 77% of 80 people said YouTube was the go-to resource but rated their experience 3.5/5 on avg. We followed up with a few people from the survey which resulted in some interesting takeaways:</p>

            <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
            <p>Converging all these details from research meant we could narrow down requirements and features through card sorting exercises. This gave us some context for the sketches and wireframes. We also derived a sitemap from these details.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>We began with simple pencil and paper drawings and progressed from low to high fidelity wireframes using feedback received from user testing.</p>

        <section id="testing">
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>We tested our first prototype with users to gain valuable feedback early on which revealed some pain points and frustrations. We continued this process throughout each part of the design phase. Some common observations were:</p>

            </div>
            <p>To quantify the improvement of our designs we used a system usability questionnaire which showed an interaction improvement of 58%.</p>

        <section id="development">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>Our development phase started around the same time as the LoFi prototype this meant that we could get the foundations setup. This gave us a head start once the design was ready.<br><br>In the time period we were unable to deliver the entire product but what we had achieved exceeded our peers’ expectations. However, it was not essential to provide the finished product as it was a university project.</p>

        <section id="takeaway">
            <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
            <p>Since this was a university module project, it was illogical to plan a project as large as that along-side of the other projects, studies, and work that we had to manage. Restricting the scope of a project to ensure it can be delivered on time is an essential skill which I’d have to work on in subsequent projects.<br><br>It’s also important to consider the technical requirements of the design as well as the user’s needs.</p>
